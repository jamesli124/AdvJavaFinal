  <p>
    Morrison.platformer is a simple, lightweight platformer game built within JavaFX. The game supports level select, and has a quicksave feature, which allows the player to save the current game state to return at a later timeâ€”even if the application has been closed.
    The player moves around the level using the arrow keys, with the goal of reaching the end. If the player falls, however, the level will be reset.
    
    In its current state, the game has three levels, which the player can choose between at will. We hope to add more features in the future, including sound, basic enemies, and microtransactions.
