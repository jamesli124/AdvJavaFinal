# AdvJavaFinal
Morrison.platformer is a simple, lightweight platformer game built within JavaFX. The game supports level select, and has a quicksave feature, which allows the player to save the current game state to return at a later time—even if the application has been closed.

The player moves around the level using the WASD keys, with the goal of reaching the end—the objective feature is still to be added. If the player falls, however, the level will be reset.


## Improvements

The current version. is essentially a proof-of-concept physics engine, which can be easily scaled and extended into a fully-featured application.

In its present state, the game has three levels, which the player can choose between at will. We hope to add more features in the future, including sound, basic enemies, parallax, texture art, and options.

## Installation
In order to build the game, you will currently need to use IntelliJ. Information on using JavaFX with IntelliJ can be found [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/developing-a-javafx-application-examples.html).
